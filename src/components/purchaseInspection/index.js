      <h2>About Mandatory Pre-Purchase Inspection</h2>
      <p>
        When you buy or sell a car, a pre-purchase inspection is recommended. 
        In some countries, this inspection is mandatory, and depending on local 
        regulations, it may be carried out by the buyer or by the seller.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all cases, the requirement is the same: to ensure transparency 
        regarding the safety condition of the vehicle before the owner changes.
